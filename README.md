## Run docker locally

```
docker build -t pycaret-streamlit-aws .
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 pycaret-streamlit-aws
```

## Deploy Streamlit Docker on Heroku

In order to deploy this on heroku, there's a need to assign the port where streamlit will run with the `$PORT` environmental variable
https://help.heroku.com/PPBPA231/how-do-i-use-the-port-environment-variable-in-container-based-apps

One way to do that is to pass the port as flags on the command line when running streamlit run:
```
streamlit run your_script.py --server.port $PORT
```
https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_configuration.html#set-configuration-options

(TODO: we might also try to specify the port in the global config file at ~/.streamlit/config.toml)

Concretely, modify line 21 of the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile):
`CMD streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT`
